# 🛡️ AI Subscription Guard: Web Tracker Proof of Concept

This is a simple frontend web application built as a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for the **AI Subscription Guard** solution. It helps users manually track recurring monthly payments and calculate the total spend, addressing the core problem of "Subscription Fragmentation" mentioned in the project proposal.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Add Subscription:** Allows users to input the name and monthly cost of a new subscription.
* **Cost Analysis:** Calculates and displays the **Total Monthly Spend** in real-time.
* **Removal:** Users can easily remove subscriptions from the tracker.
* **Simple UI:** Clean, responsive interface for easy tracking.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project focuses purely on the client-side implementation of the basic tracking functionality:

* **HTML5:** Structure of the application (`subscription_index.html`).
* **CSS3:** Basic styling and layout (`subscription_style.css`).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Core logic for data handling (adding, removing, and calculating costs) (`subscription_script.js`).
